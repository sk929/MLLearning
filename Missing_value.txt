Score from Approach 1 (Drop Columns with Missing Values)
Since we are working with both training and validation sets, we are careful to drop the same columns in both DataFrames.

# Get names of columns with missing values
cols_with_missing = [col for col in X_train.columns
                     if X_train[col].isnull().any()]

# Drop columns in training and validation data
reduced_X_train = X_train.drop(cols_with_missing, axis=1)
reduced_X_valid = X_valid.drop(cols_with_missing, axis=1)

print("MAE from Approach 1 (Drop columns with missing values):")
print(score_dataset(reduced_X_train, reduced_X_valid, y_train, y_valid))
MAE from Approach 1 (Drop columns with missing values):
183550.22137772635
Score from Approach 2 (Imputation)
Next, we use SimpleImputer to replace missing values with the mean value along each column.

Although it's simple, filling in the mean value generally performs quite well (but this varies by dataset). While statisticians have experimented with more complex ways to determine imputed values (such as regression imputation, for instance), the complex strategies typically give no additional benefit once you plug the results into sophisticated machine learning models.

from sklearn.impute import SimpleImputer

# Imputation
my_imputer = SimpleImputer()
imputed_X_train = pd.DataFrame(my_imputer.fit_transform(X_train))
imputed_X_valid = pd.DataFrame(my_imputer.transform(X_valid))

# Imputation removed column names; put them back
imputed_X_train.columns = X_train.columns
imputed_X_valid.columns = X_valid.columns

print("MAE from Approach 2 (Imputation):")
print(score_dataset(imputed_X_train, imputed_X_valid, y_train, y_valid))
MAE from Approach 2 (Imputation):
178166.46269899711
We see that Approach 2 has lower MAE than Approach 1, so Approach 2 performed better on this dataset.

Score from Approach 3 (An Extension to Imputation)
Next, we impute the missing values, while also keeping track of which values were imputed.

# Make copy to avoid changing original data (when imputing)
X_train_plus = X_train.copy()
X_valid_plus = X_valid.copy()

# Make new columns indicating what will be imputed
for col in cols_with_missing:
    X_train_plus[col + '_was_missing'] = X_train_plus[col].isnull()
    X_valid_plus[col + '_was_missing'] = X_valid_plus[col].isnull()

# Imputation
my_imputer = SimpleImputer()
imputed_X_train_plus = pd.DataFrame(my_imputer.fit_transform(X_train_plus))
imputed_X_valid_plus = pd.DataFrame(my_imputer.transform(X_valid_plus))

# Imputation removed column names; put them back
imputed_X_train_plus.columns = X_train_plus.columns
imputed_X_valid_plus.columns = X_valid_plus.columns

print("MAE from Approach 3 (An Extension to Imputation):")
print(score_dataset(imputed_X_train_plus, imputed_X_valid_plus, y_train, y_valid))
